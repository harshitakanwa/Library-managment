## Roadmap of the Project
![Roadmap of Library Management project image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jithendra1798/SE-Project/main/assets/Library%20Roadmap.jpg)

## Project Description
* As the project name suggests automation in which the human input can be minimised and makes the work of librarian a lot easier and experience of user a lot simpler.
* This has some new features like requesting book from other students, buying books from catalogue, if available for sale and reviewing and rating books and feedback of experience etc.  
* We can also track the history of users (books user has taken before and now).  
* We can also track history of books (users who took the book previously and now).  
* It makes library user and librarian work very simpler and easier.  

## Project Design Flow

## Project Requirements/Features

### 1. Admin
 * Add books
 * Confirm registration of user
 * Can see all user details
 * Remove/add users
 * Make others admin
 * Can see the books taken by user
 * Can track history of book (Users used)


### 2. User
> There are 3 types of users
 
|New registration|Active user|Old user|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Registration yet to approve|Registration Approved|User in break/due fine|
|Shows Registration Pending|Can Access completely|Limited access|

#### Active user features :
- Can lend max of 4 books.
- Request other user, if he needs a book taken by other user.
- Pays fine, if he lost the book or delays renewal of book.
- History of books he took.
- Can buy a book, if availabe to sale by another user or by library.
- Can generate and use the Library ID card in PDF
- Can give Feedback of experience while taking books

### 3. Other Features
- Automated emails to users, reminding for renewal of books
- Users can search books in the catalogue
- Lending/Taking books is of 3 categories
    - Take book from Library
    - Take book from other user
    - Buy book, if available for sale
- Automated emails on registration approval/banning/termination
- Automated generation of Library ID cards
- Different types of subscriptions for users

## Software Specifications
|Backend|Frontend|
|:---|:---|
|Django (Python)|HTML|
MySQL(Database)|CSS|
|   |JS|

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability and reliability is taken care by django, as it is simple, highly scalable and flexible.
- Security of the sensitive data transmission of users is taken care by django.
- We designed the database with high data integrity.
- The performance of the application will be good with the optimised queries in MySQL.
- Maintainability and Manageability of the application will be good, as we are following the best Software principles.
- MySQL is capable enough to scale the project to even higher.
- The portability of the application is high, as we are using one of the most popular framework.


## Objectives of Software Engineering: 

1. Maintainability – We are following best software engineering practices. So, it is feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.
2. Efficiency – The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.
3. Correctness – A software product is correct if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.
4. Reusability – A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.
5. Testability – Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.
6. Reliability – It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.
7. Portability – In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.
8. Adaptability – In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.
9. Interoperability – Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.


## Hardware Requirements :
